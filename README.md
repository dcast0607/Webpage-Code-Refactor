# Webpage-Code-Refactor
Learning HTML/CSS by refactoring a source file. 

Objective:<br />
The student is provided with a working website that needs to be refactored so that it falls in line with HTML and CSS guidelines. 

Acceptance Criteria:<br />
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br />
WHEN I view the source code<br />
THEN I find semantic HTML elements (Completed)<br />
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br />
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning (Completed)<br />
WHEN I view the icon and image elements<br />
THEN I find accessible alt attributes (Completed)<br />
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br />
THEN they fall in sequential order (Completed)<br />
WHEN I view the title element<br />
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title (Completed)<br />

Student Notes:<br />
Cleaned up the original HTML and CSS files that were provided. Updated both the HTML and CSS files so that there would be less ambiguity about what elements are being modified by the style sheet. Also added more descriptive names to the html elements and grouped similar elements in the stylesheet so that it is obvious to other developers as to what section is being modified by the style sheet.
